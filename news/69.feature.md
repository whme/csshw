The default behavior when launching `csshw` without arguments has been changed:
- when launched from an existing console terminal - the help text will be printed
- when launched from the FileExplorer or otherwise in a new console - interactive mode will be used

In interactive mode CLI arguments can be entered in the new console window directly which will remain open until closed.
