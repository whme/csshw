![csshw demo](https://github.com/whme/csshw/blob/84570f8dd767e17df0027f11a19e5e3276718787/demo/csshw.gif)[^1][^2]

## Pre-requisites
- ``Default terminal application`` is set to ``Windows Console Host`` in the windows Terminal Startup Settings (Windows 11 only)

## Overview
csshW will launch 1 daemon and N client windows (with N being the number of hosts to SSH onto).<br>
Key-strokes performed while having the daemon console focussed will be sent to all clients simoultaneously and be replayed by them.<br>
Focussing a client will cause any key-strokes to be sent to this client only.

## Usage

```cmd
