# Only runs on the main branch on pushes and pull_requests.
# Caches the rust toolchain based on the runner and RUST versions.
# Uses Swatinem/rust-cache@v2 to cache rust dependencies.
# Runs linters, formatters and tests in parallel.
#
# GitHub only supports a limited set of YAML anchors which means
# we still have to repeat ourselves for the rust-toolchain-cache step
